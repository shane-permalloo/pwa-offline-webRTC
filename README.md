## Security Considerations

This application is designed as a demonstration and has several security limitations:

- Passwords are stored in plaintext in localStorage (not recommended for production)
- All authentication happens client-side
- No server-side validation

For a production application, you would need to implement:
- Proper password hashing
- Server-side authentication
- Secure token-based sessions
- Data encryption for sensitive information
